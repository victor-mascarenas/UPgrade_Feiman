a) What is a table?

1. What is a table.

- What is a table? Well, we all have seen a table before, a table is an element used for displaing data in the form of rows and columns (different table examples are shown).

2. Table examples from the web.

- In HTML, we can create our own tables to display data. (diferent HTML table examples are shown)
- On this example we see a simple HTML table, it has rows and columns containing the data, and a header which indicates the data element that each column holds.

b) Correct use.

- Now, before we go ahead, we need to talk about the correct use of tables in HTML, it may look pretty straight forward but tables are often misused in HTML.

1. Correct use of tables (tabular data).

- As tables are defined, HTML tables are supposed to be used to display data, tabular data to be precise...

2. What is tabular data.

- And what is tabular data? well, it is essentially data wich can be shown in a table.
- So, let's say we have 3 fruits: mango, pineapple and kiwi (fruits are shown in a text manner), in order to present this data, we could use a table (fruits are shown in a table), but, is it really necessary? it depends on what you are doing, but probably it isn't, we could just use a list (fruits are shown in a list).
- Instead, if we had a bigger piece of data like this JSON file (a JSON file is shown) wich contains customers information, maybe a table would be useful.

3. Incorrect use of tables (layout).

- So that is the correct use of tables in HTML, but whats is the incorrect way? well, let's say I have to create a web page that need's to be portrayed in a "3 column way" (a page like this is shown) and I use a table for it (an X is shown over the example), that is an example of an incorrect use, tables are not supposed to be used for layout purposes, just for tabular data.
- For this previous example (the example is shown again), in order to achieve a 3 column page, you should use a layout in CSS like the grid layout.
- Using a table for layout is not a good practice.

c) Table tags.

- Ok, now we can go for creating a table.
- First of all let's create a simple web page (a web page is created).
- Now that we have our page we can create a table.

1. Table tag.

- What do we need for this? we need the table tag (the tag is shown in a text manner), which represents the main container of the table, let's do it (table tag is added).

2. Row tag.

- Next, we need to add some rows to it, for that we have the TR and TD tags (tags are shown in a text manner), which stands for table row and table data.

3. Data tag.

- The TD tag can be translated to table cells or columns if you want to.
- Let's add our first row (row is added), there we go, but nothing is getting displayed in the page, so now we need to add some TD tags.
- If the TR tag stands for a row, each TD tag we add inside will mean a column (TD tags are added into TR).
- Now we can see that the 4 customers we add as TD's inside our row are showing as 4 separate columns (the page is shown).
- But right now our table only has 1 row, let's add more, if we copy the TR and paste it 4 times below (copies the row), we end up having 5 rows (page is shown).
- So, we have a couple of rows but someting is mising, we need a header.

4. Header.

- In order to add a header, we need to add another row right after the table tag, before the other rows, let's do that (adds a row).

4.1. Heading tag.

- But for it to be a header, we are going to use the TH tag insead of the TD (changes the tag).
- And now we can see that our new row appears with bold text, because the TH tag defines a cell as a header.

d) Table attributes.

1. Deprecated attributes.
2. Style for layout (recomendation).
3. Scopes.

e) Semantic tags.

1. What & why?
2. Head tag.
3. Body tag.
4. Footer tag.

f) Captions.

1. What for?
2. Caption tag.

g) Table span's.

1. Column span.
2. Row span.

h) Grouping.

1. What for?
2. Colgroup tag.
3. Col tag.
